# 🚀 Java Design Patterns

This repository is a comprehensive collection of design pattern examples implemented in Java, intended for developers looking to learn and understand the application of these patterns in real-world scenarios. The purpose of this project is to showcase the usage of various design patterns, their benefits, and how they can improve the maintainability, flexibility, and efficiency of your code.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. Each category contains a dedicated folder with sub-folders for each pattern.

## 🧩 Patterns Included

- Creational Patterns:
    - [X] Abstract Factory
    - [X] Builder
    - [X] Factory Method
    - [X] Prototype
    - [X] Singleton

- Structural Patterns:
    - [X] Adapter
    - [X] Bridge
    - [ ] Composite
    - [ ] Decorator
    - [ ] Facade
    - [ ] Flyweight
    - [ ] Proxy

- Behavioral Patterns:
    - [ ] Chain of Responsibility
    - [ ] Command
    - [ ] Interpreter
    - [ ] Iterator
    - [ ] Mediator
    - [ ] Memento
    - [ ] Observer
    - [ ] State
    - [ ] Strategy
    - [ ] Template Method
    - [ ] Visitor

## 🔍 How to Use

Feel free to browse the repository and explore each pattern's implementation. The `README.md` files in each pattern's folder will provide you with a general understanding of the pattern and its application in real-world projects. You can also clone the repository to your local machine and experiment with the code.

## 🌟 Contributing

Contributions are more than welcome! If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to add new design pattern examples, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions will help make this repository even more valuable for the community.
